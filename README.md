# Full Stack AI Coding Agent

This project is a full-stack AI coding agent built with the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Serverless Functions (for Vercel), TypeScript
- **AI:** Google Gemini Pro

This agent is inspired by the collection of system prompts and tool definitions found in this repository.

## Project Structure

This project is a monorepo using npm workspaces.

- `packages/frontend`: The Vite/React frontend application.
- `packages/backend`: The serverless backend.
  - `packages/backend/api`: Contains the serverless function for Vercel.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm (v8 or later)
- A Google Gemini API Key

### 1. Get a Gemini API Key

1.  Go to the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2.  Sign in with your Google account.
3.  Click on **"Get API key"**.
4.  Create a new API key.
5.  Copy the key and keep it safe.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

When deploying to Vercel, you will need to set this environment variable in the Vercel project settings. You do not need a `.env` file for local development, as the frontend and backend are served from the same origin.

### 5. Running the Development Server

This command will start the Vite development server for the frontend.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. The backend serverless function will be available at `http://localhost:5173/api`.

## Deployment to Vercel

1.  **Push to GitHub:** Create a new repository on GitHub and push your code.

2.  **Import to Vercel:**
    - Go to your Vercel dashboard.
    - Click on **"Add New... > Project"**.
    - Import your GitHub repository.

3.  **Configure the Project:**
    - **Framework Preset:** Vercel should automatically detect that this is a Vite project.
    - **Root Directory:** Make sure the root directory is set to `packages/frontend`.
    - **Build and Output Settings:** These should be configured automatically by the Vite preset.
    - **Environment Variables:**
        - Go to the **"Settings"** tab of your new Vercel project.
        - Click on **"Environment Variables"**.
        - Add a new variable with the name `GEMINI_API_KEY` and the value of your API key.

4.  **Deploy:** Click the **"Deploy"** button.

Vercel will build and deploy your application. The serverless function in `packages/backend/api` will be automatically deployed as well.
