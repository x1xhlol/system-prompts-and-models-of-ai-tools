The toolset in this mode is similar to Phase Mode but adds the <code>think</code> tool for complex reasoning, and the <code>agent</code> and <code>hand_over_to_approach_agent</code> tools for creating and handing over tasks to specialized agents, indicating that this mode focuses more on detailed implementation planning and task assignment.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In summary, <code>traycer-ai</code>, through the definition of these two modes, constructs a two-tier AI agent system capable of both high-level task decomposition and detailed implementation planning, aiming to systematically solve complex software engineering tasks.</p>',6)])])}const _=o(s,[["render",n]]);export{p as __pageData,_ as default};
