It also stipulates that after making code changes, validation steps such as lint and typecheck must be run to ensure code quality.</p></li><li><p><strong><code>claude-code-tools.md</code></strong>: Defines in detail the set of tools available to Claude Code in JSON format. These tools are comprehensive, covering everything from code exploration (<code>Glob</code>, <code>Grep</code>, <code>LS</code>), file operations (<code>Read</code>, <code>Edit</code>, <code>Write</code>) to task execution and management (<code>Task</code>, <code>Bash</code>, <code>TodoWrite</code>). Particularly noteworthy is the <code>Task</code> tool, which can launch a dedicated sub-agent to handle complex tasks, as well as the <code>WebFetch</code> and <code>WebSearch</code> tools for retrieving information from the web.</p></li></ul><p>In summary, these two files together depict a powerful and rigorously workflow-oriented CLI code assistant.
