Building upon the original project, the documentation has been further summarized and localized. Therefore, my summary focuses on the Chinese version, and the English part might not be entirely accurate. However, for native prompts, it is best to refer back to the original English text in the repository. The project has been completely refactored into a modern static documentation website using the VitePress tech stack, aiming to provide a better browsing and reading experience. Custom scripts in the `scripts` directory are used to batch convert source files into a unified Markdown format, generating both &#39;zh&#39; and &#39;en&#39; document folders. The generated Markdown documents are translated and proofread, completing the localization to prepare for a bilingual website. A bilingual static website is built based on VitePress, with deep customization including theme, navigation, and homepage layout. Finally, it is deployed on Vercel to save deployment costs. However, since most translations are done by AI, some translations might contain errors. If in doubt, it is recommended to directly check the content of the original repository. </p></div>',2)])])}const u=t(a,[["render",s]]);export{h as __pageData,u as default};
