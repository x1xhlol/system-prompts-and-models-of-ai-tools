Using custom scripts in the `scripts` directory, the source files are batch converted into a unified Markdown format, and two document folders, zh and en, are generated. The generated Markdown documents are translated and proofread to complete the Chinese localization in preparation for the subsequent bilingual website. A bilingual static website is built based on VitePress, with deep customization including theme, navigation, and homepage layout. However, since most of the translation and conversion was done by AI, some errors may exist. If you have any doubts, it is recommended to check the content of the original repository directly. </p></div>',2)])])}const h=t(n,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,h as default};
