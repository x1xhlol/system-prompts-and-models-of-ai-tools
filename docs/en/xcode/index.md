## Summary of Product Tool Documents

This directory contains various operational instructions defined for the AI coding assistant integrated with Xcode. Each document corresponds to a specific user action, detailing how the assistant should respond, what templates to use, and what rules to follow when receiving the corresponding instructions. For example, `DocumentAction.md` is used to generate documentation for selected code, `PreviewAction.md` is used to create previews for SwiftUI views, and `System.md` defines the assistant's core behavior, code analysis capabilities, and interaction principles with the Apple ecosystem (e.g., Swift, SwiftUI). These documents collectively form the functional and behavioral specifications of the AI assistant in Xcode.
