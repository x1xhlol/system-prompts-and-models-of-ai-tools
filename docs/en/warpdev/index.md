## Summary of Product Tool Documents

The documents in this directory define the core specifications for "Agent Mode", an AI agent running within Warp (an AI terminal). Its primary purpose is to assist users in solving software development problems and tasks through the terminal interface. The `Prompt.md` file elaborates on the agent's code of conduct, including how to distinguish between problems and tasks, handle instructions of varying complexity, use external context, and interact with various tools (e.g., `run_command`, `read_files`, `edit_files`). Additionally, the document specifies best practices for coding, version control, security (handling secrets), and output formatting, forming a complete functional and operational guide for "Agent Mode".
