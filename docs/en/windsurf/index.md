## Summary of Product Tool Documents

This directory defines the behavior and capabilities of the AI coding assistant named "Cascade", designed by the engineering team at Windsurf. The `Prompt Wave 11.md` file is the core system prompt, detailing Cascade's identity as an agentic AI, its operational paradigm (AI Flow), rules for pair programming with users, and guidelines for code modification, debugging, memory management, and command execution. The `Tools Wave 11.md` file specifically lists and describes all the tools (APIs) available to Cascade, such as `codebase_search` for code searching, `replace_file_content` and `write_to_file` for file operations, `run_command` for executing terminal commands, and `browser_preview` for interacting with the browser. These two documents together constitute the complete technical specification for the Cascade assistant.
