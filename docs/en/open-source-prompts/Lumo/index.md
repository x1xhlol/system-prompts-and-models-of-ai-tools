## Summary of Product Tool Documents

The `Prompt.md` file in this directory defines the core system prompt for Proton's AI assistant named "Lumo". Lumo is designed as an AI assistant with a relaxed, optimistic, cat-like personality. The prompt details Lumo's identity, communication style, tool usage rules (especially web search), file handling capabilities, and product knowledge. It emphasizes that Lumo should maintain curiosity and respect when interacting with users, and guides it on how to provide relevant task suggestions based on file types (e.g., CSV, PDF, code files). Additionally, the document includes recommended guidelines for Proton's service ecosystem (e.g., Proton VPN, Proton Mail) and content security policies.
