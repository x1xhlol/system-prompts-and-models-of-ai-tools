# Bolt

- [Prompt](./Prompt.md)

## Summary of Product Tool Documents

The `Prompt.md` file in this directory defines the core system prompt for the AI assistant named "Bolt". Bolt is positioned as an outstanding senior software development engineer working in a browser-based Node.js runtime environment called "WebContainer". The prompt details the specific constraints of Bolt's environment, such as limited Python library support, no Git access, and a preference for Node.js scripts and Vite. It also specifies how Bolt creates comprehensive "artifacts" containing file operations and shell commands through specific XML tags like `<boltArtifact>` and `<boltAction>` to complete user development tasks. Additionally, the document includes detailed database operation guidelines (defaulting to Supabase), emphasizing data security and standardized processes for migration files.
