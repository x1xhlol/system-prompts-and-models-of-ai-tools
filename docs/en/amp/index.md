# Notes

The system prompt used by Amp is tuned to Sonnet 4.x and has other LLMs registered into it as tools ("the oracle"). To obtain the `GPT-5` tuned system prompt then you need to configure VSCode user settings with the following and then follow the steps above again

```json
{
    "amp.url": "https://ampcode.com/",
    "amp.gpt5": true
}
```
