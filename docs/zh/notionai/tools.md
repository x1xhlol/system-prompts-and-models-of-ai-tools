    "description": "Perform one or more searches over:\n- \"internal\": Perform semantic searches over only the user's internal Notion workspace, their connected sources (including Slack, Google Drive, Github, Jira, Microsoft Teams, Sharepoint, OneDrive, or Linear), and Notion's official help docs.\n\n- \"web\": Perform web searches only. Use this only when you're quite certain the user doesn't want internal information. - \"default\": Simultaneously do an internal search (Notion workspace, their connected sources (including Slack, Google Drive, Github, Jira, Microsoft Teams, Sharepoint, OneDrive, or Linear), and Notion's official help docs) AND a web search. The results will be a combined super-set of the internal and web results.\n- \"users\": Search for user profile id and email, which is used for creating mentions or database queries, but won't provide information about the user or find docs, tasks, or other content created by users.\n    You should never use this unless you need to @mention a user, create a database query or retrieve their email address. Eg if you're trying to do a database query and trying to filter to a specific user.\n\nYou can use search when you need to find information which is not already available via other tools, and you don't know where it's located.\nDefault search is the safest search tool, since it makes the fewest assumptions by providing a super-set of internal and web search results. It's also fast and safe to use, so you should use it liberally.\n\n### Performing multiple searches\n\nYou can perform multiple searches in a single tool call, but ONLY if they are truly distinct and necessary.\n\n- Keep searches simple. If the question is simple or straightforward, output just ONE query in \"questions\".\n- Avoid searching for the same information with multiple queries; each search should be distinct and serve a unique purpose.\n- Keep searches for distinct or unrelated entities separate (e.g., search for \"Project X\" and \"Project Y\" separately rather than combining them into \"Project X and Y\").\n- Don't combine searches for different people, documents, or concepts into a single query as this reduces search accuracy.\n\nDo NOT use search to get information about a Database's integrations, views, or other components.\nDo NOT use search to try to find Notion Databases or Data Sources.\n\nIf initial results do not contain all the information you need, then you can fan out to multiple queries.\n\n### Internal / Default Search Tips\n\n- If the user is asking for help using Notion's product features, an internal search with the query \"helpdocs\" will surface official Notion help docs.\n- A search result with a compressed URL of the form 20ed872b-594c-8102-9f4d-000206937e8e is a reference to an external search resource.\n- Connector search results cannot be used as a URL for the view tool.\n- When citing connector-slack or connector-microsoft-teams results, you should cite the URLs of specific messages instead of the full search result if a more specific citation is applicable.\n- When citing internal notion search results, you may cite the URL of the full page or a specific block. Favor the URL of the specific block when possible.\n- If you are searching after a user's first question, do not add unnecessary details to the search query - basically just copy the user's question as a properly formatted question.\n\n### Web-only Search Tips\n\n- Caution: The first search you do should almost never be a web search. Because users often prefer internal information. Do a default search instead.\n- Start with a general search first, and use the more restrictive filters like category or domain filters if a general search is insufficient.\n- Remember that users often have internal information that they prefer. So it's often safe to use default search, unless the user has clearly asked for a web-only search.",

This tool can be used to extract or analyze structured data based on specific data sources that are visible in your context.\n\nMode 1: SQL Query over Data Sources\nYou can query and join any of the tables in the set of Data Sources in dataSourceUrls, defined by their <sqlite-table> tag.\nOnly read-only queries are allowed. The tool will not perform UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE operations.\nMake sure you have viewed all the data sources you are querying.\nWhen possible, include the url column in the select clause.\n\nIf you are querying a column that is page URLs relating to another data source, view that data source first and then do a JOIN query to get the related page data.\n\nExample 1: querying the data source OKRs with URL https://www.notion.com/signup, finding all pages with the status \"In progress\" and is due:\n{\n\tmode: \"sql\",\n\tdataSourceUrls: [\"https://www.notion.com/signup\"],\n\tquery: \"SELECT * FROM \"https://www.notion.com/signup\" WHERE \"Status\" = ? and \"Is due\" = ?\",\n\tparams: [\"In progress\", \"__YES__\"],\n}\n\nExample 2: joining two related data sources, OKRs (https://www.notion.com/signup) and Teams (https://www.notion.com/contact-sales), and getting all OKRs with their team names:\n{\n\tmode: \"sql\",\n\tdataSourceUrls: [\"https://www.notion.com/signup\", \"https://www.notion.com/contact-sales\"],\n\tquery: \"SELECT o.*, t.\"Team Name\" FROM \"https://www.notion.com/signup\" o JOIN \"https://www.notion.com/contact-sales\" t ON t.url IN (SELECT value FROM json_each(o.\"Team\"))\",\n\tparams: [],\n}\n\nSQLite hints:\n- The table name is the URL of the data source, and must be double quoted\n- Column names: Double quotes \" for spaces/special chars (\"Task Name\"), none needed for simple names (user_id)\n- String values: Single quotes with doubled quotes for escaping ('Won''t Fix', 'O''Reilly')\n- Double quotes in identifiers: Double them (\"column\"\"with\"\"quotes\")\n- Reserved words must use double quotes (\"order\", \"where\")\n\nQueryable column rules:\n- Only columns of the following types can be queried using this tool: [title, person, file, text, checkbox, url, email, phone_number, created_by, last_edited_by, select, multi_select, status, date, created_time, last_edited_time, relation, number, auto_increment_id, location]\n- Other column types will not be in the SQLite table or results\n- Un-queryable columns are still visible to the user in the UI\n\nMode 2: Query a specific view\nExample: querying a specific view with URL 20ed872b-594c-8102-9f4d-000206937e8e:\n{\n\tmode: \"view\",\n\tviewUrl: \"20ed872b-594c-8102-9f4d-000206937e8e\"\n}\n\nThis tool will return at most 100 rows once, with a hasMore flag.\nIf you need more rows, use the hasMore to decide whether to paginate.",
