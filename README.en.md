# AI System Prompts Hub (VitePress Enhanced Edition)

This project is a remastered version of [x1xhlol/system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools](https://github.com/x1xhlol/system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools).

On the basis of the original project, I used the **VitePress** tech stack to completely refactor it into a modern static documentation site, aiming to provide a better browsing and reading experience. I used custom scripts in the `scripts` directory to batch convert the source files into a unified Markdown format, creating both `zh` and `en` document folders. The generated documents were then translated and proofread to complete the localization for a bilingual site. Finally, the entire site was built and deeply customized using VitePress, including the theme, navigation, and homepage layout. A semi-automated workflow is also configured to check for upstream updates and generate reports for manual syncing.

As a large portion of the translation and conversion was done with the assistance of AI, there may be some errors. If you have any doubts, it is recommended to consult the content of the original repository.
